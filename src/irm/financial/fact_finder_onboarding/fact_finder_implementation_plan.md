# plan, next step and sample code

Certainly! I'd be happy to help you develop an interactive agent using Python and ChatGPT's real-time capabilities to ask the questions from the **MassMutual Financial Planning Condensed Factfinder**. Here's how you can proceed:

---

## **Overview**

We'll create a Python script that:

1. Uses the OpenAI API to leverage ChatGPT.
2. Presents the questions to the user interactively.
3. Collects and stores the responses securely.
4. Validates inputs where necessary.

---

## **Prerequisites**

1. **OpenAI API Access**: Ensure you have an API key from OpenAI. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/signup/).

2. **Python Environment**: Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.

3. **Install Required Libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

---

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. Import Necessary Libraries**

We'll need the `openai` library for interacting with ChatGPT and `json` for handling data.

```python
import openai
import json
```

### **2. Set Up OpenAI API Key**

Replace `'your-api-key-here'` with your actual OpenAI API key.

```python
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'
```

### **3. Define the Questionnaire**

We'll structure the questionnaire based on the sections provided.

```python
questionnaire = {
    "Client/Co-Client Information": [
        {"question": "Please enter the client's name:", "field": "client_name"},
        {"question": "Please enter the client's date of birth (DOB):", "field": "client_dob"},
        {"question": "Is the client not a U.S. citizen? (Yes/No):", "field": "client_not_us_citizen"},
        {"question": "Please enter the co-client's name:", "field": "co_client_name"},
        {"question": "Please enter the co-client's date of birth (DOB):", "field": "co_client_dob"},
        {"question": "Is the co-client not a U.S. citizen? (Yes/No):", "field": "co_client_not_us_citizen"},
        {"question": "Please provide the home address:", "field": "home_address"},
        {"question": "Please select the tax filing status (Single, Head of Household, Married Filing Jointly, Married Filing Separately):", "field": "tax_filing_status"}
    ],
    # Add other sections similarly...
}
```

### **4. Create a Function to Interact with ChatGPT**

This function will handle the conversation with the user.

```python
def ask_chatgpt(question):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",  # Use "gpt-3.5-turbo" if you don't have access to GPT-4
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant collecting financial planning information."},
            {"role": "user", "content": question}
        ],
        temperature=0  # Set temperature to 0 for more deterministic responses
    )
    answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()
    return answer
```

### **5. Collect Responses**

Iterate through the questionnaire and collect responses.

```python
def collect_responses(questionnaire):
    responses = {}
    for section, questions in questionnaire.items():
        print(f"\n--- {section} ---\n")
        responses[section] = {}
        for item in questions:
            question = item['question']
            field = item['field']
            # Ask the question using ChatGPT
            answer = ask_chatgpt(question)
            responses[section][field] = answer
            print(f"{question}\n{answer}\n")
    return responses
```

### **6. Input Validation (Optional but Recommended)**

For critical fields like dates and amounts, you might want to validate the inputs.

```python
import re
from datetime import datetime

def validate_date(date_text):
    try:
        datetime.strptime(date_text, '%Y-%m-%d')  # Expecting 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
        return True
    except ValueError:
        return False

def validate_yes_no(answer):
    return answer.lower() in ['yes', 'no']
```

Modify the `collect_responses` function to include validation:

```python
def collect_responses(questionnaire):
    responses = {}
    for section, questions in questionnaire.items():
        print(f"\n--- {section} ---\n")
        responses[section] = {}
        for item in questions:
            question = item['question']
            field = item['field']
            while True:
                answer = ask_chatgpt(question)
                # Add validation based on the field
                if 'dob' in field:
                    if validate_date(answer):
                        break
                    else:
                        print("Invalid date format. Please use YYYY-MM-DD.")
                elif 'yes_no' in field:
                    if validate_yes_no(answer):
                        break
                    else:
                        print("Please answer 'Yes' or 'No'.")
                else:
                    break
            responses[section][field] = answer
            print(f"{question}\n{answer}\n")
    return responses
```

### **7. Main Function to Run the Script**

```python
def main():
    responses = collect_responses(questionnaire)
    # Save responses to a file or process them as needed
    with open('client_responses.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(responses, f, indent=4)
    print("Thank you for providing your information.")
```

### **8. Run the Script**

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

---

## **Putting It All Together**

Here's the complete script:

```python
import openai
import json
import re
from datetime import datetime

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'

def ask_chatgpt(question):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",  # Use "gpt-3.5-turbo" if you don't have access to GPT-4
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant collecting financial planning information."},
            {"role": "user", "content": question}
        ],
        temperature=0
    )
    answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()
    return answer

def validate_date(date_text):
    try:
        datetime.strptime(date_text, '%Y-%m-%d')  # Expecting 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
        return True
    except ValueError:
        return False

def validate_yes_no(answer):
    return answer.lower() in ['yes', 'no']

def collect_responses(questionnaire):
    responses = {}
    for section, questions in questionnaire.items():
        print(f"\n--- {section} ---\n")
        responses[section] = {}
        for item in questions:
            question = item['question']
            field = item['field']
            while True:
                answer = ask_chatgpt(question)
                # Add validation based on the field
                if 'dob' in field:
                    if validate_date(answer):
                        break
                    else:
                        print("Invalid date format. Please use YYYY-MM-DD.")
                        continue
                elif 'not_us_citizen' in field or 'yes_no' in field:
                    if validate_yes_no(answer):
                        break
                    else:
                        print("Please answer 'Yes' or 'No'.")
                        continue
                else:
                    break
            responses[section][field] = answer
            print(f"{question}\n{answer}\n")
    return responses

def main():
    responses = collect_responses(questionnaire)
    with open('client_responses.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(responses, f, indent=4)
    print("Thank you for providing your information.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Define the questionnaire as before
    questionnaire = {
        "Client/Co-Client Information": [
            {"question": "Please enter the client's name:", "field": "client_name"},
            {"question": "Please enter the client's date of birth (YYYY-MM-DD):", "field": "client_dob"},
            {"question": "Is the client not a U.S. citizen? (Yes/No):", "field": "client_not_us_citizen"},
            {"question": "Please enter the co-client's name:", "field": "co_client_name"},
            {"question": "Please enter the co-client's date of birth (YYYY-MM-DD):", "field": "co_client_dob"},
            {"question": "Is the co-client not a U.S. citizen? (Yes/No):", "field": "co_client_not_us_citizen"},
            {"question": "Please provide the home address:", "field": "home_address"},
            {"question": "Please select the tax filing status (Single, Head of Household, Married Filing Jointly, Married Filing Separately):", "field": "tax_filing_status"}
        ],
        # Add other sections similarly...
    }
    main()
```

---

## **Extending the Questionnaire**

You can continue adding sections to the `questionnaire` dictionary following the same format. For example:

```python
questionnaire = {
    # Existing sections...
    "Income": [
        {"question": "Please enter your gross salary ($):", "field": "gross_salary"},
        {"question": "Please enter your bonus/other income ($):", "field": "other_income"},
        # Add more fields as necessary
    ],
    # Add other sections...
}
```

---

## **Considerations**

### **1. Input Validation**

Ensure that you validate inputs where necessary, especially for:

- **Dates**: Use a consistent format like `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Numerical Values**: Ensure that amounts are numbers and handle currency formatting.
- **Selections**: For fields with predefined options, ensure the user's input matches one of them.

### **2. Data Security and Compliance**

Since you're handling sensitive financial and personal information:

- **Encryption**: Consider encrypting the stored data.
- **Compliance**: Ensure you're compliant with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, or other relevant data protection laws.
- **Privacy Policy**: Inform users how their data will be used and stored.

### **3. Error Handling**

- Implement try-except blocks to handle unexpected errors.
- Provide meaningful error messages to the user.

### **4. User Experience**

- **Clarity**: Make sure questions are clear and unambiguous.
- **Feedback**: Acknowledge receipt of each answer.
- **Assistance**: Allow users to ask for clarification if they don't understand a question.

### **5. Logging**

- Keep logs of interactions for auditing purposes.
- Ensure logs do not contain sensitive information or are stored securely.

---

## **Next Steps**

### **1. Test the Script**

- Run the script and test it thoroughly.
- Check that all validations work as intended.
- Ensure that data is being saved correctly.

### **2. Deploying the Agent**

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: For initial testing, a CLI might suffice.
- **Web Application**: For client-facing interactions, consider using a web framework like Flask or Django.
  - Use web forms to collect data.
  - Secure the application with HTTPS.
- **Chatbot Interface**: Deploy the agent on platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or a web chat widget.

### **3. Advanced Features**

- **Session Management**: Allow users to pause and resume the questionnaire.
- **Multilingual Support**: If needed, enable the agent to handle multiple languages.
- **Analytics**: Collect anonymized data to improve the questionnaire.
