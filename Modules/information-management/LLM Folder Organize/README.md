# LLM Folder Organize

## This module is in the idea phase - Work in progress

## Overview

The LLM Folder Organize module is designed to manage and organize files and folders using LLMs. It provides a structured approach to storing, retrieving, and managing LLM files, ensuring efficient use of storage and easy access to relevant information.

## Key Features

- **File Organization**: Automatically organizes files into folders based on their content and metadata.
- **Folder Management**: Provides tools to create, rename, and delete folders.
- **Version Control**: Tracks changes to files and folders, ensuring a history of all modifications.
- **Security**: Implements security measures to protect sensitive information.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and management of files and folders.

## Usage

To use the LLM Folder Organize module, follow these steps:

1. **File Upload**: Upload the files you want to organize.
2. **Folder Creation**: Create folders to store the files.

Potential Benefits:
1. Reduces clutter in the downloads folder
Saves time in manual file organization
Improves file retrieval efficiency
Helps maintain a consistent file structure
Questions to consider before implementation:
User Consent and Privacy:
How will we ensure user consent for scanning and modifying their downloads folder?
What measures will be in place to protect user privacy and sensitive information?
File Classification:
What criteria will be used to categorize files (e.g., file type, content, date)?
How will the system handle ambiguous cases or files that fit multiple categories?
Folder Structure:
What will be the default folder structure for organizing files?
Will users be able to customize the folder structure?
Tagging System:
How will the tagging system work on macOS?
Will we use existing macOS tagging features or implement a custom solution?
User Interface:
How will users interact with this feature (e.g., command-line, GUI, or both)?
Will there be options to preview changes before applying them?
Frequency and Automation:
Will the organization process run automatically or be user-initiated?
How often should the system scan for new files to organize?
Conflict Resolution:
How will the system handle naming conflicts or existing files?
Will there be an option to merge or overwrite existing files?
Undo Functionality:
Will users be able to undo the organization if they're not satisfied with the results?
Performance:
How will we ensure the scanning and organization process doesn't significantly impact system performance?
File Type Support:
What file types will be supported for organization and tagging?
How will the system handle unknown or rare file types?
11. Integration:
How will this sub-module integrate with the broader Information Management Module and the IRM System as a whole?
12. Cross-platform Considerations:
While initially focusing on macOS, how might we design the system to be adaptable for other operating systems in the future?
